# vahak_assessment

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a demo assessment for Wiki Search Api integration.

### Task Status

Parse JSON from the API response: <B>Completed</B>

Each list item should display appropriate data from the API. Show whichever fields you think are necessary: <B>Completed</B>

Clicking a list item launches the respective Wikipedia page: <B>Completed</B>

The UI specification is left to you. Build the UX and use appropriate UI widgets to give the best experience as you see fit for a Wiki search application: <B>Completed</B>

Cache responses to give a good offline experience: <B>Completed</B>

Display description with image and title. All these 3 things are very important to display in the list: <B>Completed</B>
